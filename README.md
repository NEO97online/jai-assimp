# jai-assimp

Jai bindings for [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp).

Warning: This is not polished yet at all.

Currently only tested on Windows. 

The Assimp source is include in this repo, but ideally we would submodule it.

It is also prebuilt for Windows only; we should add a compilation step.
